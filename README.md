## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[W3Schools and StackOverflow]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[An issue I developed while trying to add new features to the project was the random pattern feature. My experience with other languages meant that I knew how to theoretically implement the feature to the code, but I did not have the fluency in Javascript necessary to do so. In order to solve the issue, I went to W3Schools and StackOverflow. On StackOverflow, I checked to see if others had also had similar issues with similar projects. Having found an issue similar, I utilized the concept into my own code. After that, I went to W3Schools to read up on the Math.random function to see if there was anything more I needed to add to my code. When I was confident in my code, I proceeded to test it and it functioned perfectly.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[After I finished the prework, I was curious about how other websites may have been created. Considering the fact that this project is fairly simple compared to the work of others, I gained a new appreciation for those in the front end field. Seeing the amount of code needed for such a simple project made me wonder about the amount of code necessary for other websites like Twitter, where it is full of features and links to other sites. Prior to this project I had never had any experience with front end development and suffice it to say, I gained an appreciation for the field.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I were to spend a few more hours on the project, I would like to research and learn how to implement a neverending mode. Theoretically, I can envision how to implement such a mode into the code, add another button that will start the mode and essentially make the game run as normal without a winning method. Which would ensure that the game would go on forever until one loses. Another feature I would like to add is different shapes, having the different buttons be different shapes would elevate the game and perhaps introduce another challenge to the game.
